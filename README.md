## Sunpaper

Sunpaper is a linux utility to change wallpaper based on local sunrise and sunset times. 

It works with several modified [dynamic themes](#wallpaper-previews) to move through eight images depending on the position of the sun at your location and time of year.

Compatible with any distribution and window manager (X or wayland).

## Why Sunpaper?

Dynamic wallpapers are awesome, but transitions are usually based on static timetables. I wanted something that could adapt to sunrise and sunset changes over the year without any input from me. The idea is to as closely recreate the Apple Big Sur Dynamic Desktop behavior as possible.
